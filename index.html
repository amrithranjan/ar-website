        <h2>Statement of Purpose</h2>
        <p>I am driven by the challenge of connecting the seemingly disparate fields of economics, computer science, biomedical research, and
            environmental policy to create solutions that are both data-informed and human-centered. Whether analyzing racial disparities
            in education through econometrics, enhancing cancer treatment delivery systems in the lab, or exploring sustainable plastic policies,
            I seek to uncover patterns and build systems that improve lives. My goal is to apply my technical and analytical skills across sectors
            to solve complex problems at the intersection of science, policy, and society.</p>

        <p>Dear Company,</p>
        <p>As a dual major in Economics and Computer Science with a deep
            passion for data analysis and research, I bring a unique interdisciplinary
            skill set that bridges quantitative problem-solving with technical proficiency.
            My background in research, healthcare, and business makes me a strong candidate
            for this opportunity.</p>

        <p>During my research on enhancing the efficacy of Korean Red Ginseng as a cancer treatment,
            I utilized liposomal drug delivery methods in a lung carcinoma model, reinforcing my
            analytical skills and attention to detail. Additionally, my coursework in Econometrics
            has refined my ability to interpret complex data sets, which I apply through coding in
            Java, R, Python, C++, and lower-level languages like Assembly. My experiences interning
            at the Washington Tennis and Education Foundation (WTEF) also provided me with insights
            into business operations, event planning, and strategic outreach.</p>

        <p>Beyond my academic and professional experiences, I am passionate about healthcare and education.
            As a pre-dental student, I have shadowed professionals across various specialties, including
            Pediatrics, Orthodontics, General, and Endodontics, further deepening my understanding of patient
            care. Additionally, my volunteer work with Girls Excited about Math and Science (GEMS) has allowed
            me to inspire young students to explore STEM fields. I also shadow at a genetics research clinic at
            the University of Virginia, where I engage with cutting-edge scientific advancements. I am eager to bring my analytical skills, technical expertise, and passion for interdisciplinary problem-solving to future opportunities.
        </p>

        <p>Sincerely,</p>
        <p>Amrith Ranjan</p>

    <section class="dental motivation" id="common app essay">
        <p>I always got to witness the joy of Western holidays through my friends and neighbors.
            Begrudgingly I thought we would never have any fun. But, when I lost my first tooth,
            my mom introduced me to the Tooth Fairy. Finally a little magic.</p>

        <p>Looking back, I realize my mom used the Tooth Fairy as a manipulative strategy; I can still
            hear her saying, “If you don’t brush your teeth, the Tooth Fairy will never want them.”
            So, every morning and night, my twin sister and I would competitively brush our teeth
            together to ensure that the Tooth Fairy would not overlook us. I would love going to the
            dentist so I could excitedly exclaim that five more dollars had appeared from another lost
            tooth. I believed in my endless supply of teeth that would always garner me a fortune.
            But, I soon learned my fate: only a few baby teeth remained.
            Tooth Fairy visits were nearing an end.</p>

        <p>When I was thirteen years old, the Tooth Fairy sadly said goodbye. I’m not sure if it was
            my mom’s emphasis on brushing or a little magic, but a growing interest in dentistry had
            started to bloom.</p>

        <p>I was able to have the opportunity to shadow for over 100 hours, learning about different
            procedures and how a dental practice is run. I observed dental procedures and practice’s
            operations, prepped patients for appointments, assisted in taking x-rays, and made goody
            bags filled with toothbrushes, toothpaste, mouthwash, and floss.</p>

        <p>From a young age, dentistry seemed to be the right career for me. Additionally, through
            research and hands-on practice, it became more apparent. My skills at crocheting and
            playing the flute helped me work with both hands and the dental tools. Experience at
            blood drives and vaccination centers helped me learn how to work with patients.
            Even the annual dentist visits as a kid were something I looked forward to, despite
            being many children's fear.</p>

        <p>However, I truly found my passion for dentistry when I interned later at a general practice,
            Smiles at Sunrise.</p>

        <p>Working at a general practice helped me realize that dentistry is more than pretty smiles
            and telling kids to floss. In particular, during a three hour appointment, one patient
            explained how growing up in Rockbridge County there were no dental practices near him,
            causing him to need extensive procedures for his teeth when older. Somehow, between creating
            goody bags for kids and watching cavities get filled, I had forgotten that many people did
            not grow up in luxury.</p>

        <p>Through diversifying my dental experience, I recognized the need for dental care in impoverished
            areas. The passion I was searching for was not in the career but the location I chose, for the
            patient and a generation to come. While my interest in dentistry started as a kid appreciating five
            dollars under the pillow, I hope my passion can help share the magic of the Tooth Fairy for generations
            to come.</p>
